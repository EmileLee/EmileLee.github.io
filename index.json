However, owing to the poor light-gathering capability of its imaging system, the dynamic performance of DGS is heavily restricted. Here, a method of enhancing the dynamic performance of DGS by improving its speckle target is proposed. The method employs the technique of backlight illumination, which significantly increases the utilization efficiency of light, shorten the exposure time, and enhance the dynamic performance of DGS. Besides, it also uses the optimized digital speckle pattern to improve the measurement precision and accuracy. For validation, a comparison experiment was conducted, proving that the proposed method can improve the utilization efficiency of light by about 80 times and improve the quality of the speckle images by about 40%. Real tests, including a uniaxial tension test using transmission-mode DGS (t-DGS) and a three-point bending test using reflection-mode DGS (r-DGS), were also carried out, showing the efficacy and high compatibility of the proposed backlight digital speckle target. In a word, this simple method greatly improves the performance of DGS, which can be used as a standard method in both t-DGS and r-DGS.","tags":["DIC","DGS","Backlight"],"title":"Enhanced digital gradient sensing using backlight digital speckle target","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605512701,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605512701,"objectID":"fd7bd990fd5b9bc7c6809d6d0b128f79","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/talk/2020-26bstam/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T15:45:01+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-26bstam/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"2020 26BSTAM","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605512645,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605512645,"objectID":"dd31857022dfe63e785f51e078c3cc9f","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/talk/2020-ifosa/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T15:44:05+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-ifosa/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"2020 Ifosa","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605512636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605512636,"objectID":"6db7e3f10d7b1f2d3a13c480d9b288b4","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/talk/2020-idics/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T15:43:56+08:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-idics/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"2020 Idics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bo Dong","Chenzhuo Li","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1605500532,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605500532,"objectID":"d6e645d692f1da1d538aa7d300e4621b","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2020-apl-fluorescent/","publishdate":"2020-11-16T12:22:12+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-apl-fluorescent/","section":"publication","summary":"Fluorescent digital image correlation (DIC) has been implemented on monocular and binocular fluorescence microscopes for shape and deformation measurements at the microscale and even the nanoscale by tracking fluorescent particles. This technique, however, has not been used with regular optical imaging systems for DIC measurements at the macroscale so far. In this Letter, by combining the photoluminescence nature of fluorescent materials and bandpass filtering imaging, we discover that fluorescent DIC also features some distinct advantages in macroscale characterizations, e.g., specular reflection elimination, high speckle contrast, and the capability to simultaneously observe superficial/internal surfaces of transparent structures. To show these advantages and reveal the potential applications of fluorescent DIC, comparative experiments, including shape, displacement, and deformation measurements, were carried out. Furthermore, some issues accompanied by employing fluorescent imaging in DIC were discussed. This study indicates that upgrading classic DIC to fluorescent DIC can significantly improve its performance, enhance its functions, and expand its applications without introducing additional problems.","tags":["DIC"],"title":"Fluorescent digital image correlation applied for macroscale deformation measurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenzhuo Li","Haojian Luo","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602143144,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1602143144,"objectID":"c1807e56d36bad0e3c06dde92857ff62","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2020-rsi-ht/","publishdate":"2020-10-08T15:45:44+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-rsi-ht/","section":"publication","summary":"High-throughput measurement of thermal deformation and determination of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) using a high-resolution digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera and digital image correlation (DIC) is described. To mitigate the mosaic effect caused by the Bayer filter of DSLR cameras, a color image pre-processing method, which adjusts the brightness and equalizes the color channels of the raw image, is carried out. In addition, a Gaussian pre-filtering step is adopted for denoising the images captured with DSLR cameras to enhance the subpixel registration accuracy. Then, by processing the recorded images using the state-of-the-art DIC algorithm, full-field displacements and strains can be determined. Compared with conventional industrial cameras, a DSLR camera offers not only portability, compactness, and economy but also much higher resolution of recorded images, allowing CTE characterization with higher throughput. Real experiments, including a verification experiment of the color image pre-processing technique, a benchmark CTE determination of Al alloy, and a high-throughput CTE determination of 15 samples of three different metals, validated the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed technique. The proposed method is cost-effective and time-saving, showing great potential in the high-throughput CTE measurement and other high-throughput strain measurement scenarios.","tags":["DIC","High temperature","High throughput"],"title":"High-throughput measurement of coefficient of thermal expansion using a high-resolution digital single-lens reflex camera and digital image correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenzhuo Li","Bo Dong","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"990c62bdae6e2510d9b5adcdcdd61463","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2019-mst-microscopic/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-mst-microscopic/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel, flexible and easy-to-implement single-camera microscopic three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) technique for accurate full-field shape, motion and deformation measurements at the microscale. The established microscopic 3D-DIC system comprises a single 3CCD color camera, a high-magnification zoom lens, and a specially designed color separation device using a beam splitter, two optical bandpass filters and three plane mirrors. To perform accurate stereo measurement, color images of a test sample surface are recorded by the 3CCD camera, which observes the test sample via the microscopic imaging system from two different optical paths with the aid of the color separation device. The recorded color images can be subsequently separated to red and green channel sub-images which constitute stereo pairs corresponding to different perspectives. The separated stereo pairs can be subsequently analyzed using regular 3D-DIC to extract full-field 3D shape and deformation of the test object surface. The method was first validated by a series of benchmark tests, involving the 3D shape reconstruction of steel balls with different diameters, in-plane and out-of-plane translation tests. Surface 3D deformation measurement of a planar acrylic plate with micro-features was also performed to show the practicality of the proposed method. This method provides new simple and practical avenues for performing shape and deformation measurement at microscale, showing great potential in both material testing and bio-tissue characterization.","tags":[],"title":"A flexible and easy-to-implement single-camera microscopic 3D digital image correlation technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Dong","Chenzhuo Li","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fddb706b53d5103679b624778d4cea55","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2019-ol-extensometer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-ol-extensometer/","section":"publication","summary":"Video extensometer assesses mechanical properties of materials by measuring their length changes under different loadings with combined use of video recording and image processing.
