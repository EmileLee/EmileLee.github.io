This technique, however, has not been used with regular optical imaging systems for DIC measurements at the macroscale so far. In this Letter, by combining the photoluminescence nature of fluorescent materials and bandpass filtering imaging, we discover that fluorescent DIC also features some distinct advantages in macroscale characterizations, e.g., specular reflection elimination, high speckle contrast, and the capability to simultaneously observe superficial/internal surfaces of transparent structures. To show these advantages and reveal the potential applications of fluorescent DIC, comparative experiments, including shape, displacement, and deformation measurements, were carried out. Furthermore, some issues accompanied by employing fluorescent imaging in DIC were discussed. This study indicates that upgrading classic DIC to fluorescent DIC can significantly improve its performance, enhance its functions, and expand its applications without introducing additional problems.","tags":["DIC"],"title":"Fluorescent digital image correlation applied for macroscale deformation measurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenzhuo Li","Bo Dong","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"990c62bdae6e2510d9b5adcdcdd61463","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2019-mst-microscopic/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-mst-microscopic/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel, flexible and easy-to-implement single-camera microscopic three-dimensional digital image correlation (3D-DIC) technique for accurate full-field shape, motion and deformation measurements at the microscale. The established microscopic 3D-DIC system comprises a single 3CCD color camera, a high-magnification zoom lens, and a specially designed color separation device using a beam splitter, two optical bandpass filters and three plane mirrors. To perform accurate stereo measurement, color images of a test sample surface are recorded by the 3CCD camera, which observes the test sample via the microscopic imaging system from two different optical paths with the aid of the color separation device. The recorded color images can be subsequently separated to red and green channel sub-images which constitute stereo pairs corresponding to different perspectives. The separated stereo pairs can be subsequently analyzed using regular 3D-DIC to extract full-field 3D shape and deformation of the test object surface. The method was first validated by a series of benchmark tests, involving the 3D shape reconstruction of steel balls with different diameters, in-plane and out-of-plane translation tests. Surface 3D deformation measurement of a planar acrylic plate with micro-features was also performed to show the practicality of the proposed method. This method provides new simple and practical avenues for performing shape and deformation measurement at microscale, showing great potential in both material testing and bio-tissue characterization.","tags":[],"title":"A flexible and easy-to-implement single-camera microscopic 3D digital image correlation technique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bo Dong","Chenzhuo Li","Bing Pan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"fddb706b53d5103679b624778d4cea55","permalink":"https://EmileLee.github.io/publication/2019-ol-extensometer/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-ol-extensometer/","section":"publication","summary":"Video extensometer assesses mechanical properties of materials by measuring their length changes under different loadings with combined use of video recording and image processing. In this Letter, an ultrasensitive video extensometer implemented on a single-camera dual field-of-view (dual FOV) telecentric imaging system is proposed. The method integrates the idea of FOV separation and telecentric imaging, which can increase the strain resolution with an order of magnitude and enhance the strain accuracy significantly. Validation experiments indicate that the root mean square error of a video extensometer was effectively decreased from 25.2 to 4.4 microstrains after employing the proposed method. Time-varying thermal strains of Al alloy and alumina ceramic samples were also precisely measured by the established ultrasensitive video extensometer, confirming its accuracy and practicality.","tags":["DIC","Video Extensometer"],"title":"Ultrasensitive video extensometer using single-camera dual field-of-view telecentric imaging system","type":"publication"}]
